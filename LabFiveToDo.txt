Setup
// 1. Quagga on routers, configure routing tables so everything can reach everything
// 		Note: Nodes 5 and 6 should be subnetted: what is the route? what routers did you use it on?


1. Static routing, delete appropriate routes from routing table on usRTR 
2. Routing table on usRTR
		- remove all non-local (except users), note which machines can't communicate (node0 w/ anything)

Coding
1. Build a routing table that contains destNet, next-hop IP, and MAC next-hop
2. Capture packets sent to router
3. If packetDest is local, ignore
4. Else if packetDest matches routing table
	- do stuff
5. Else
	- drop?


Testing
IPERF
1. Packets per second: smallest possible, then increasing sending rate until dropping packets
	- calculate max pps 
2. Throughput: largest possible UDP
    - calculate max throughput
	- Why are file transfer ppl interested in throughput with 1024^2 vs network 10^6??

Why is CIDR important?
	- So you can map whole subnets at once, and non-local routers don't have to worry about individual hosts in a subnet
